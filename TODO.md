MENU RECOMMENDATIONS

For this menu system I would recommend creating a database for your menu items and perhaps even an API. This could be beneficial in the future to be able to have an editing system, so you donâ€™t have to update the JS object every time the menu changes. This would also be good to setup up if in the future you would like to implement some type of ordering system to the website.

Other recommendations would be to add a filter for vegetarian or meat dishes, beside the spicy filter. It would be also good to have your store location and hours somewhere on the page, perhaps in the footer, with your page copyright information.
