CM Internship Questions - Completed by Megan Krenbrink April 2022

WORK PROJECT EXAMPLES

1.	Meals on Mules: One of the most recent projects I worked on was “Meals on Mules” a grocery store app where you could browse and order products. My team consisted of 2 designers and 3 developers. I took on the role of the Back-End Developer since our other 2 Developers where not confident in creating a RESTfulAPI. Even though I had also never made one before I thought the challenge would be fun. I worked with the designers to communicate what information was needed and focused mainly on the products and building various parameters to get necessary data. Once I completed the API I created documentation to help the other developers use the resource. I also had to step in and help the other developers to show the rendered data on screen (similar to the method used in the menu code challenge). 
I’ve provided the files to the API code, documentation and a short video of the final version of the app that was developed with React Native, on my GitHub: https://github.com/megbort/Meals-on-Wheels-API

2.	WearIt Clothing: This was an earlier project that I got to work on with my Project Management team. For this project we had a Project Manager, designer, UX/UI designer and a developer. I took on the role of developer as I wanted to get more practice coding. This was one of the projects that made me realize how much I enjoyed coding, especially when I have the ability to work with the designers. This project is currently featured on my portfolio with a breakdown of my process and a link to the live site. I have plans on creating this in to a full functioning e-commerce site in the future. I really enjoy the design and concept of the project.

3.	Portfolio Website: I also wanted to feature my portfolio since this is a project I’ve taken the role of the designer, developer and QA testing. It was an opportunity to show my brand and create whatever I wanted. It’s also where I got to ensure all best practices for accessibility, DRY code and SEO. I was also able to setup monitor Google Analytics & Google Search Console.

INSPIRATION

1.	Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) -  Wordle is a popular online puzzle word game that my friend introduced me to recently. The concept and idea is very simple but also very fun. This game is done (or can be done) entirely with Vanilla JavaScript. Code Academy wrote an article on the game and even explain how it’s built. Link to the article: https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/how-to-code-wordle-game-in-javascript/. Super fun and would love to try and build my own word game sometime.

2.	Tiggy (https://hello.gotiggy.com/) – Tiggy was our direct inspiration for the “Meals on Mules” project. I admired everything they did with the design, website and app. Great and simple design, with consistent branding across all platforms. As well as a responsive and functional website and application. This was also helpful for me to get a sense of what type of parameters we would need for the project (ex: sort by department; meat, frozen, etc.)

3.	Bandcamp Album/Artist Page (https://joeychaos.bandcamp.com/album/immolation) - This page has actually inspired me to try and improve the page’s overall appearance and functionality. Bandcamp is a great platform to promote and display music, however it’s been the same design for the past 10+ years. I’ve recently built a custom audio player with Vanilla JavaScript which I would use and continue to develop on. I think this would be a fun project to do.

FOCUS

There’s no shortage of ideas I have when it comes to thing that I would love to learn and build during my first 6 months. It could be creating or building a new tool or a new feature for a website, or learn more advance skill perhaps with JavaScript or a framework. I could even build a website, page or improve a user interface. I also think it would be great to get better with coding principles and learn all the best practices.

# 2022 Internship Menu Exercise

Tackle the following steps to create a menu for a "Fancy Italian Restaurant".

## 1. Sorting 

- In `index.js`, loop over `menuItems` and categorize them into sections based on each items assigned `type`
- Sort the items in each category by their `menuOrder`

## 2. Rendering

- Render the sorted results into the appropriate container with `index.html`
- Format any prices. For example, 8.5 becomes \$8.50
- Render the "spicy" icon next to any menu items where `spicy` is `true`

## 3. Styling

- Add some "italian menu" styling to boost your stores sales. Use Google Images if you need inspiration.

## 4. BONUS: Filtering

- Add a checkbox to toggle spicy options. When the checkbox is checked, the spicy options should be visible. It should be checked by default.

## 5. BONUS: What You'd Change

- Create a new file called "TODO.md". Add any additional changes you'd recommend making if this was a project you were working on for a real client.
